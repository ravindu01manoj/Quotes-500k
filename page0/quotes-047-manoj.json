These moments were his platonic nights of love. Books had power over him; money never did. Great collectors, including the founder of a collection in Princeton University Library, tried in vain to recruit him as an adviser and buyer for their libraries—Jakob Mendel declined; no one could imagine him anywhere but in the Café Gluck.

That was when he had first found his way to the Café Gluck, and gradually it became his workplace, his headquarters, his post office, his world. Like an astronomer alone in his observatory, studying myriads of stars every night through the tiny round lens of the telescope, observing their mysterious courses, their wandering multitude as they are extinguished and then appear again, so Jakob Mendel looked through his glasses out from that rectangular table into the other universe of books, also eternally circling and being reborn in that world above our own.","author":"Stefan Zweig, The Collected Stories of Stefan Zweig","category":"book-lovers, books, collecting-books, knowledge, love, obsession, reading"},{"quote":"When ignorance is passed down for a long time without giving it a second thought, it leads to evil because you are doing it without knowledge.","author":"Nouman Ali Khan","category":"ignorance, knowledge"},{"quote":"Where the senses fail us, reason must step in.","author":"Galileo Galilei","category":"knowledge, reason, science"},{"quote":"There is a huge difference between thinking we know something and actually knowing something.","author":"Eraldo Banovac","category":"difference, difference-quotes, knowing, knowing-quotes, knowledge, knowledge-quotes, life-quotes, motivational-quotes, philosophy, philosophy-quotes, sociology, sociology-quotes"},{"quote":"What is essence of knowledge, if it does not change the way we act?","author":"Lailah Gifty Akita","category":"action, behaviour-wisdom, change, education, inspiring-thoughts, knowledge"},{"quote":"I realized that the knowledge I gained over this period in my life was power, and it felt like a waste not to share that wealth with the world, with people who could benefit,","author":"Andrew Kendall, The Dark Dictionary: A Guide to Help Eradicate Your Darkness, Restore Your Light, and Redefine Your Life.","category":"beneficial, knowledge, knowledge-of-self, life, power, realization, share, the-dark-dictionary, waste, wealth"},{"quote":"Whoever holds the keys to house of knowledge, must open the door, for those who search for light of knowledge to enter.","author":"Lailah Gifty Akita","category":"christian, education, knowledge, learning, life-philosophy, search, seek"},{"quote":"The key to knowledge is the kingdom of God.","author":"Lailah Gifty Akita","category":"christian, education, kingdom-of-god, knowledge, life-lessons"},{"quote":"If you seek first God's Kingdom, shall find the key to knowledge.","author":"Lailah Gifty Akita","category":"gods-kingdom, inspirational, knowledge, seek, self-help"},{"quote":"The course of our lives can be altered when we receive the gift of knowledge.","author":"Denis Hachey, Mind to Mind Conversation: Change Your Mind, Change Your Life","category":"change, change-your-life, knowledge"},{"quote":"Perhaps the secret to life is to understand simplistic perfection.

It is the multiplication of the evidence of fallible and biased witnesses, combined with incomplete accounts of actions not fully understood by the people who performed them. It’s no more than the best we can do, and often it falls short of that.","author":"Hilary Mantel","category":"evidence, history, knowledge"},{"quote":"In my school, no consideration is given to anything unreasonable; the heart of the matter is to use the power of the knowledge of martial arts to gain victory any way you can.","author":"Miyamoto Musashi, The Book of Five Rings","category":"culture, knowledge, martial-arts, power, reason, samurai, school, schooling, unreasonable, victory"},{"quote":"To fix hearts one must know one's own.","author":"Will Advise","category":"fix, hearts, knowing-oneself, knowledge, love, mend, repair"},{"quote":"You can't go too wrong with books","author":"Dr. Lucas D.

Our external permanency would not be external, in our sense, if it was restricted in its influence to one individual. It must be something which affects, or might affect, every man. And, though these affections are necessarily as various as are individual conditions, yet the method must be such that the ultimate conclusion of every man shall be the same. Such is the method of science. Its fundamental hypothesis, restated in more familiar language, is this: There are Real things, whose characters are entirely independent of our opinions about them; those Reals affect our senses according to regular laws, and, though our sensations are as different as are our relations to the objects, yet, by taking advantage of the laws of perception, we can ascertain by reasoning how things really and truly are; and any man, if he have sufficient experience and he reason enough about it, will be led to the one True conclusion. The new conception here involved is that of Reality.","author":"Charles Sanders Peirce, The Fixation of Belief","category":"belief, knowledge, reality, science, scientific-method, theory"},{"quote":"Science is the human endeavor to elevate the self and the society from the darkness of ignorance into the light of wisdom.","author":"Abhijit Naskar","category":"brainy-quotes, inspirational, knowledge, pursuit-of-knowledge, science, science-quotes, scientific-research, scientist, scientists, thinkers, truth, wisdom"},{"quote":"Worldly ambition inhibits true learning.

You’ve been a consultant for a long time, and you’ve dealt a great deal with top secret information. But you’re about to receive a whole slew of special clearances, maybe fifteen or twenty of them, that are higher than top secret.I’ve had a number of these myself, and I’ve known other people who have just acquired them, and I have a pretty good sense of what the effects of receiving these clearances are on a person who didn’t previously know they even existed. And the effects of reading the information that they will make available to you.First, you’ll be exhilarated by some of this new information, and by having it all—so much! incredible!—suddenly available to you. But second, almost as fast, you will feel like a fool for having studied, written, talked about these subjects, criticized and analyzed decisions made by presidents for years without having known of the existence of all this information, which presidents and others had and you didn’t, and which must have influenced their decisions in ways you couldn’t even guess. In particular, you’ll feel foolish for having literally rubbed shoulders for over a decade with some officials and consultants who did have access to all this information you didn’t know about and didn’t know they had, and you’ll be stunned that they kept that secret from you so well.You will feel like a fool, and that will last for about two weeks. Then, after you’ve started reading all this daily intelligence input and become used to using what amounts to whole libraries of hidden information, which is much more closely held than mere top secret data, you will forget there ever was a time when you didn’t have it, and you’ll be aware only of the fact that you have it now and most others don’t … and that all those other people are fools.Over a longer period of time—not too long, but a matter of two or three years—you’ll eventually become aware of the limitations of this information. There is a great deal that it doesn’t tell you, it’s often inaccurate, and it can lead you astray just as much as the New York Times can. But that takes a while to learn.In the meantime it will have become very hard for you to learn from anybody who doesn’t have these clearances. Because you’ll be thinking as you listen to them: “What would this man be telling me if he knew what I know? Would he be giving me the same advice, or would it totally change his predictions and recommendations?” And that mental exercise is so torturous that after a while you give it up and just stop listening. I’ve seen this with my superiors, my colleagues … and with myself.You will deal with a person who doesn’t have those clearances only from the point of view of what you want him to believe and what impression you want him to go away with, since you’ll have to lie carefully to him about what you know. In effect, you will have to manipulate him. You’ll give up trying to assess what he has to say. The danger is, you’ll become something like a moron. You’ll become incapable of learning from most people in the world, no matter how much experience they may have in their particular areas that may be much greater than yours.","author":"Greg Grandin, Kissinger's Shadow: The Long Reach of America's Most Controversial Statesman","category":"knowledge, politics, thinking"},{"quote":"You can't reign in obscurity you can't shine in your comfort zone.","author":"Bamigboye Olurotimi","category":"ability, choice, comfort, comfort-zone, decision, determination, idea, knowledge, life, obscurity, performance, progress, reign, reigning, security, shine, success, transformation, vision"},{"quote":"You must know what you need to do every day to carry out your mission","author":"Sunday Adelaja","category":"calling, daily, knowledge, life, mission, need, purpose"},{"quote":"The person who knows his calling will find opportunities everywhere","author":"Sunday Adelaja","category":"calling, find, knowledge, opportunities, people, person, place, places, purpose"},{"quote":"Learning becomes the knowledge builder and we can define learning through the information it absorbs and the capability it builds.","author":"Pearl Zhu, Digital Gaps: Bridging Multiple Gaps to Run Cohesive Digital Business","category":"gap, knowledge, learning"},{"quote":"They had never previously been obliged to engage in such mental effort, and it gave them headaches.

Unfortunately, that kind of education is virtually calculated to bore and alienate gifted minds. But instead of making exceptions where it would do the most good, the educational bureaucracy often prefers not to be bothered.In my case, for example, much of the schooling to which I was subjected was probably worse than nothing. It consisted not of real education, but of repetition and oppressive socialization (entirely superfluous given the dose of oppression I was getting away from school). Had I been left alone, preferably with access to a good library and a minimal amount of high-quality instruction, I would at least have been free to learn without useless distractions and gratuitous indoctrination. But alas, no such luck.Let’s try to break the problem down a bit. The education system […] is committed to a warm and fuzzy but scientifically counterfactual form of egalitarianism which attributes all intellectual differences to environmental factors rather than biology, implying that the so-called 'gifted' are just pampered brats who, unless their parents can afford private schooling, should atone for their undeserved good fortune by staying behind and enriching the classroom environments of less privileged students.This approach may appear admirable, but its effects on our educational and intellectual standards, and all that depends on them, have already proven to be overwhelmingly negative. This clearly betrays an ulterior motive, suggesting that it has more to do with social engineering than education. There is an obvious difference between saying that poor students have all of the human dignity and basic rights of better students, and saying that there are no inherent educationally and socially relevant differences among students. The first statement makes sense, while the second does not.The gifted population accounts for a very large part of the world’s intellectual resources. As such, they can obviously be put to better use than smoothing the ruffled feathers of average or below-average students and their parents by decorating classroom environments which prevent the gifted from learning at their natural pace. The higher we go on the scale of intellectual brilliance – and we’re not necessarily talking just about IQ – the less support is offered by the education system, yet the more likely are conceptual syntheses and grand intellectual achievements of the kind seldom produced by any group of markedly less intelligent people. In some cases, the education system is discouraging or blocking such achievements, and thus cheating humanity of their benefits.","author":"Christopher Langan","category":"autodidacticism, brilliance, brilliant, bureaucracy, children, education-reform, educational-system, genius, gifted, gifted-people, giftedness, good-intentions, indoctrination, intellectual, knowledge, sad-truth, science, self-education, simple-truth, social-justice, socialization, the-road-to-hell, unfairness, youth"},{"quote":"The system that aims at educating our boys and girls in the same manner as in the circus where the trainer teaches the lion to sit on a stool, has not understood the true meaning of education itself.

It depends on the consciousness on the part of the working people in all professions of their responsibility for the social process. This consciousness may be present or it may grow in an organic manner, like a tree or an animal organism. The growth of this consciousness of social responsibility is the most important prerequisite for the prevention of the cancer-like growth of political systems in the social organism. If they are allowed to grow, they will sooner or later bring about social chaos. Furthermore, such consciousness of responsibility alone will, in the course of time, bring the institutions of human society into harmony with the natural functions of work democracy. Political systems come and go without stopping or fundamentally changing the social process. But the pulse of human society would stopand not return should the natural life functions of love, work and knowledge cease for only one day. Natural love, vitally necessary work and scientific search are rational life functions. They can inherently be nothing but rational. Consequently, they are diametrically opposed to any kind of irrationalism. Political irrationalism which infests, deforms and destroys our lives, is — in the strictly psychiatric sense—a perversion of social life, caused by the ostracizing of the natural life functions and by their exclusion from the determination of social life.","author":"Wilhelm Reich, The Mass Psychology of Fascism","category":"consciousness, knowledge, love, social-responsibility, work, work-democracy"},{"quote":"People tell me it's a sinTo know and feel too much within","author":"Bob Dylan","category":"feelings, knowledge, sin"},{"quote":"The father of doubts has a son of knowledge.","author":"Sudheer Reddy","category":"deep-thoughts, doubt, knowledge"},{"quote":"Q.

This passage quotes a ‘certain Chinese encyclopaedia’ in which it is written that ‘animals are divided into: (a) belonging to the Emperor, (b) embalmed, (c) tame, (d) suckling pigs, (e) sirens, (f) fabulous, (g) stray dogs, (h) included in the present classification, (i) frenzied, (j) innumerable, (k) drawn with a very fine camelhair brush, (l) et cetera, (m) having just broken the water pitcher, (n) that from a long way off look like flies’. In the wonderment of this taxonomy, the thing we apprehend in one great leap, the thing that, by means of the fable, is demonstrated as the exotic charm of another system of thought, is the limitation of our own, the stark impossibility of thinking that.","author":"Michel Foucault, The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences","category":"absurdism, borges, epistemology, knowledge, meaning-making, metaphysics, ontology, philosophy, social-constructionism, taxonomy, truth"},{"quote":"The only sort of pride that may serve a man well on that rarest occasion is his hatred of being wrong.
