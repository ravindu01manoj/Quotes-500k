Then we are frustrated that the kids aren't old enough and we'll be more content when they are. After that we're frustrated that we have teenagers to deal with. We will certainly be happy when they are out of that stage. We tell ourselves that our life will be complete when our spouse gets his or her act together, when we get a nicer car, are able to go on a nice vacation, when we retire. The truth is, there's no better time to be happy than right now. Your life will always be filled with challenges. It's best to admit this to yourself and decide to be happy anyway. One of my favorite quotes comes from Alfred D Souza. He said, \"For a long time it had seemed to me that life was about to begin - real life. But there was always some obstacle in the way, something to be gotten through first, some unfinished business, time still to be served, a debt to be paid. Then life would begin. At last it dawned on me that these obstacles were my life.\"This perspective has helped me to see that there is no way to happiness. Happiness is the way. So, treasure every moment that you have. Stop waiting until you finish school, until you go back to school, until you lose ten pounds, until you gain ten pounds, until you have kids, until your kids leave the house, until you start work, until you retire, until you get married, until you get divorced, until Friday night, until Sunday morning, until you get a new car or home, until your car or home is paid off, until spring, until summer, until fall, until winter, until you are off welfare, until the first or fifteenth, until your song comes on, until you've had a drink, until you've sobered up, until you die, until you are born again to decide that there is no better time than right now to be happy.","author":"Crystal Boyd","category":"inspirational, live-in-the-moment, live-today, motivation, motivational"},{"quote":"Learn to love mornings! Everyday is a fresh start. You've a lot to look forward to. Your whole life is in front of you.

To be with someone whose eyes light up when yours do, whose heart races when your blood also pounds, who is enticed and inspired by the same forces that drive you forward, is a gift many of us never truly get to experience.Because we settle. We settle for the person we love over the person who could push us – to be bigger, stronger, greater versions of ourselves. We tell ourselves that love is enough. That it conquers everything. But we forget that love shouldn’t be the thing that conquers our lives – we should be. And we should do it deliberately, triumphantly, by the side of somebody who shares all of our joys and successes.So how do we meet such a person? That’s simple – we do more of what we love. We give ourselves up to uncertainty, to searching, to pursuing what we want out of life without the certainty of having someone beside us while we do it. We throw ourselves wholeheartedly into the things that we love and we consequently attract the people who love what we love. Who value what we prioritize. Who appreciate all that we are. We throw ourselves into the heart of possibility instead of staying comfortably settled inside of certainty. Because we owe it to ourselves to do so. We owe it to ourselves to live the greatest life that we’re capable of living, even if that means that we have to be alone for a very long time.At the end of the day, love is wonderful but it isn’t enough to make up for an entire lifetime of compromising your core values. You don’t want to spend forever gazing into somebody’s eyes expecting to find all of the answers you need inside of them. Wait for the person who is gazing outward in the same direction as you are.It’s going to make all of the difference in the world","author":"Heidi Priebe","category":"inspirational, motivational"},{"quote":"Imagination is an extraordinary resource within each of us with powers not found in ordinary thought processes.","author":"Deborah Sandella","category":"creativity, inspirational, motivational, wellness, women-authors"},{"quote":"To see something as either black or white is easy.

The process seems to be working well, but you may be forgetting one thing.You may, at any time, encounter unexpected problems on the way to your goals. This is quite usual, however, sometimes problems which stand in your way seem so easy to solve that you find a quick solution with a very little effort and try to get rid of the problem. At first glance, things go right. You suppose that you have handled the situation successfully, but the surprise is not late; you realize that your solution is actually a terrible one that causes bigger problems in a way that you would never expect. Bingo!Never let the fact that finding a solution seems to be easy lead you to think that the problem is not serious.

You'll never find that person that completes you. If you tried and you failed doesn’t mean you should stop trying. Keep trying, never give up, and never stop to believe in yourself. Because if you don’t, nobody else will. So never lose focus, believe you will make it and most importantly, always smile, because life’s a beautiful thing and there is so much to smile about in life.","author":"Ane Krstevska","category":"inspirational, motivational"},{"quote":"If you want to live your life to the fullest you must start believing in yourself today.","author":"Nurudeen Ushawu","category":"encouragement-quotes, inspirational, inspirational-quotes, life-and-living, life-changing, life-philosophy, motivational, motivational-quotes, optimism-positive-attitude, optimism-quotes"},{"quote":"Make the best of life while it last, tomorrow is a gift","author":"Ane Krstevska","category":"inspirational, motivational"},{"quote":"Only love drives out hate because its only light that can conquer darkness","author":"Ane Krstevska","category":"inspirational, motivational"},{"quote":"We accept what we think is best for us.","author":"Ane Krstevska","category":"inspirational, motivational"},{"quote":"Perfection is overrated, creativity is the genius and it's better to be considered crazy than to be boring.","author":"Ane Krstevska","category":"inspirational, motivational"},{"quote":"Even though fairy tales are fictitious, they made us believe that dragons exist and you can overcome them.","author":"Ane Krstevska","category":"inspirational, motivational"},{"quote":"Hate is not the opposite of love but indifference.

This country as in the 'cooperation' of The United States of America has never been about the true higher-good of the people. Know and remember this.Cling to your faith.Roll your spiritual sleeves up and get to work. Use your energy wisely. Transmute all anger, panic and fear into light and empowerment.Don't use what fuels them; all lower-energy.Mourn as you need to. Console who you need to—and then go get into the spiritual and energetic arena. There's plenty work for us to do; within and without.Let's each focus on becoming 'The President of Our Own Life.Cultivate your mind. Pursue your purpose. Shine your light. Elevate past—and reject—any culture of low vibrational energy and ratchetness. Don't take fear, defeat or anger—on or in.The system is doing what they've been created to do.Are you? Am I? Are we—collectively?Let's get to work.No more drifting through life without your higher-self in complete control of your mind.Awaken—fully. Activate—now. Put your frustrations or concerns into your work.Don't lose sight. There is still—a higher plan.Let's ride this 4 year energetic-wave like the spiritual gangsters that we are.This will all be the past soon. Let's get to work and stay dedicated, consistent and diligent. Again, this will all be the past soon. We have preparing and work to do.Toxic energy is so not a game.Toxic energy and low vibrations are being collectively acted out on the world stage.Covertly operating through the unconscious weak spots and blind spots in the human psyche; making people oblivious to their own madness, causing and influencing them to act against–their–own–best–interests and higher-good, as if under a spell and unconsciously possessed. This means that they are actually nourishing the lower vibrational energy with their lifestyle, choices, energy and habits, which is unconsciously giving the lower-energy the very power and fuel it needs—for repeating and recreating endless drama, suffering and destruction, in more and more amplified forms on a national and world stage.So what do we do? We take away its autonomy and power over us while at the same time empowering ourselves. By recognizing how this energetic/spiritual virus or parasite of the mind—operates through our unawareness is the beginning of the cure. Knowledge is power. Applied knowledge is—freedom.Our shared future will be decided primarily by the changes that take place in the psyche of humanity, starting with each of us— vibrationally.In closing and most importantly,the greatest protection against becoming affected or possessed by this lower-energy is to be in touch with our higher vibrational-self. We have to call our energy and power back. Being in touch with our higher-self and true nature acts as a sacred amulet, shielding and protecting us from the attempted effects. We defeat evil not by fighting against it (in which case, by playing its game, we’ve already lost) but by getting in touch with the part of us that is invulnerable to its effects— our higher vibrational-self.Will this defeat and destroy us?Or will it awaken us more and more?Everything depends upon our recognizing what is being revealed to us and our stepping out of the unconscious influence of low vibrational/negative/toxic/evil/distraction energy (or whatever name you relate to it as)that is and has been seeking power over each of our lives energetically and/or spiritually, and step into our wholeness, our personal power, our higher self and vibrate higher and higher daily.Stay woke my friends—let's get to work.","author":"Lalah Delia","category":"activism, america, black-lives-matter, courage, do-the-work, energetic, energy, get-involved, guru, heal-the-world, higher-good, inspiration, journey, lalah-delia, motivational, native-lives-matter, one-love, social-issues, speak-up, spirit, spirituality, stay-woke, students, teacher, the-work, unity, vibes, vibrate-higher, vibrational, wholeness"},{"quote":"A new mind, equals a new life.","author":"Lalah Delia","category":"brain-function, encouragement, growth, inspirational-quotes, lalah-delia, meditation, mind, mind-power, mindfulness, motivation, motivational, personal-growth, spirituality, spirituality-quotes, transformation"},{"quote":"I always stay hungry, never satisfied with current accomplishments.","author":"Arnold Schwarzenegger","category":"inspirational-quotes, motivational"},{"quote":"Work and pray rather instead of watching and wishing.","author":"Anonymous","category":"inspirational, motivational"},{"quote":"I am not confined to the standard of society.

And if that sounds impossible, consider this: Say you’re now looking at your picks. Could you compare them to each other and say which one is more beautiful? For example, who is more beautiful— Katie Holmes or Angelina Jolie? How about Angelina Jolie or Catherine Zeta-Jones? I think intelligence is like this. So many factors are involved that attempts to measure it are useless. Not that IQ tests are useless. Far from it. Good tests work: They measure a variety of mental abilities, and the best tests do it well. But they don’t measure intelligence itself.","author":"Marilyn Vos Savant","category":"analytics, bias, brilliance, brilliant, genius, gifted, gifted-people, giftedness, inspirational, intelligence, iq, math, mathematics, mental, motivational, prejudice, psychology, science, statistics, test"},{"quote":"Common will please, but never impress.","author":"Avinash Rao","category":"extraordinary, motivational, thoughts"},{"quote":"I have nothing but a great head to offer.Is that enough?","author":"Sola Kosoko","category":"avant-garde, famousquotes, inspirational, motivational, quoteaddicts, quotegeeks, quoteme, quoteoftheday, readersofinstagram, success, writersofinstagram"},{"quote":"We will either find a way, or make one.","author":"Aníbal Barça","category":"determination, historic, motivational, resilience"},{"quote":"We are all capable of so much more than we think, the only thing we need to do is change our beliefs","author":"Steven Aitchison","category":"inspirational, inspiring-quotes, motivational, quotes-on-life"},{"quote":"Getting weak is easy.

Even if you're not, pretend to be. No one can tell the difference. Don't allow the phone to interrupt important moments. It's there for your convenience, not the callers. Don't be afraid to go out on a limb. That's where the fruit is. Don't burn bridges. You'll be surprised how many times you have to cross the same river. Don't forget, a person's greatest emotional need is to feel appreciated. Don't major in minor things. Don't say you don't have enough time. You have exactly the same number of hours per day that were given to Pasteur, Michaelangelo, Mother Teresa, Helen Keller, Leonardo Da Vinci, Thomas Jefferson, and Albert Einstein. Don't spread yourself too thin. Learn to say no politely and quickly. Don't use time or words carelessly. Neither can be retrieved. Don't waste time grieving over past mistakes Learn from them and move on. Every person needs to have their moment in the sun, when they raise their arms in victory, knowing that on this day, at his hour, they were at their very best. Get your priorities straight. No one ever said on his death bed, 'Gee, if I'd only spent more time at the office'. Give people a second chance, but not a third. Judge your success by the degree that you're enjoying peace, health and love. Learn to listen. Opportunity sometimes knocks very softly. Leave everything a little better than you found it. Live your life as an exclamation, not an explanation. Loosen up. Relax. Except for rare life and death matters, nothing is as important as it first seems. Never cut what can be untied. Never overestimate your power to change others. Never underestimate your power to change yourself. Remember that overnight success usually takes about fifteen years. Remember that winners do what losers don't want to do. Seek opportunity, not security. A boat in harbor is safe, but in time its bottom will rot out. Spend less time worrying who's right, more time deciding what's right. Stop blaming others. Take responsibility for every area of your life. Success is getting what you want. Happiness is liking what you get. The importance of winning is not what we get from it, but what we become because of it. When facing a difficult task, act as though it's impossible to fail.","author":"Jackson Brown  Jr.","category":"inspiratioanl, life-lessons"},{"quote":"There is a season for wildness and a season for settledness, and this is neither.
