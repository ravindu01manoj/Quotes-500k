Therefore it is, that for the speculation and thought which are within the scope of human endeavour not all the universe together is sufficient, our conceptions often pass beyond the bounds which limit it; and if a man were to look upon life all around, and see how in all things the extraordinary, the great, the beautiful stand supreme, he will at once know for what ends we have been born.",

When they examine images of faces that express different kinds of emotion, power-oriented subjects are drawn to nonconfrontational visages, such as \"surprise faces,\" rather than to those that suggest dominance, as \"anger faces\" do. In contrast, people spurred by affiliation gravitate toward friendly or joyful faces.",

The lessons it teaches are much like those of \"Ben Hur,\" and in this respect it might be viewed as anticipatory of the work of Wallace. The possibilities of will-power and self-control appealed tremendously to my vivid imagination, and I began to discipline myself. Had I a sweet cake or a juicy apple which I was dying to eat I would give it to another boy and go through the tortures of Tantalus, pained but satisfied. Had I some difficult task before me which was exhausting I would attack it again and again until it was done. So I practiced day by day from morning till night. At first it called for a vigorous mental effort directed against disposition and desire, but as years went by the conflict lessened and finally my will and wish became identical.",
