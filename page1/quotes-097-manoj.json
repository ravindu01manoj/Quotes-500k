In this way, great leaders are often humble leaders, thereby reducing the status threat. Great leaders provide clear expectations and talk a lot about the future, helping to increase certainty. Great leaders let others take charge and make decisions, increasing autonomy. Great leaders often have a strong presence, which comes from working hard to be authentic and real with other people, to create a sense of relatedness. And great leaders keep their promises, taking care to be perceived as fair.","author":"David Rock, Your Brain at Work: Strategies for Overcoming Distraction, Regaining Focus, and Working Smarter All Day Long","category":"leadership"},{"quote":"To create oneself as a Leader the foundation of Integrity must be laid, built with character and aspirations of greatness","author":"Bluenscottish","category":"bluenscottish, character, greatness, integrity, leadership"},{"quote":"Think of strength, dream of strength, live of strength.","author":"Abhijit Naskar, Principia Humanitas","category":"brainy-quotes, courage, inspirational, inspiring, leaders, leadership, passion, pursuit-of-passion, strength, strength-and-courage, strength-of-character, wisdom, words-of-inspiration"},{"quote":"Marketing without sales is dead.","author":"Richie Norton","category":"dead, digital-marketer, digital-marketing, entrepreneurship, leadership, marketer, marketing, markets, richie-norton, sales, salesman, selling, startup, without"},{"quote":"Tethered to our smart phones, we are too caught up and distracted to take the time necessary to sort through complexity or to locate submerged purpose .

But with the Enlightenment, we began the search for a more scientific understanding - physics, chemistry, biology and so forth. Not that we become atheists, but we gained deeper understanding about how the universe ticks.Similarly, every time we attribute everything to 'Leadership,\" we're no different from the people in the 1500's. We're simply admitting our ignorance.
