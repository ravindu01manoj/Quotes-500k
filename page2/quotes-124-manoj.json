I look at thepurple flowers between my fingers and feel the heat of her skin, the way it slides beneath my palm, soft as silk. And that vibration moves through my arm again.Her breath quickens.I find myself moving closer as her blue eyes go wide with wonder. My heart stutters and my chest aches with some unknown need.“Are you doing this?” I ask. Is she making me want this?“No,” she breathes. The smell of her turns to spice, sharp and warm, and I know I’m sensing her now, even through the block in the house.We stand like that for an eternity, still as statues on the outside, but inside I’m running, running toward a place I’ve never been. I should be terrified. But all I feel is strength. Rightness.And then Kara moves, her hands skimming up my chest, testing the boundaries. Her palms slide to my shoulders, her fingers tracing the line of the muscles in my arms, down to my waist. She grips my shirt, stretching it a little, waiting for me to tell her to stop. But I watch her lift it, let her pull it up, raising my arms, and I even take the last of it off myself, dropping it to the floor.We breathe, staring at each other.The vibrations move between us. My left arm buzzes with them. I think she’s doing it. Whatever’s happening, it’s her.I reach up and brush my marked knuckles across her cheek, amazed at the feel of her, the way her eyes seem to see everything, the way she pulls me into her. I can’t seem to remember why I shouldn’t kiss her. And kiss her. And . . .I kiss her, taking her face in both hands, skimming my thumb over her jaw as she leans into the touch, reaching out to curl her fingers around the back of my neck. I have to remind myself to breathe. I need more of her. The emotions roll over me in a rush, a tangle of sensation and movement, heat and sugar and heady aromas.I grip her tighter.Her nails dig into my shoulders. My hands slide down her spine. The kiss deepens, goes on forever, until I can barely see sense. I explore her shape, the feel of her ribs, the textures and taste of her skin on my tongue as I kiss her neck, her shoulders, her chest. As I draw trembling gasps from her lips, she grips me so hard it hurts.Our bodies mesh. Our breath mingles in frenzied desperation. Nothing else exists except her. Her warmth. Her spice.

On one level, of course, it is a game: a pure pretense with no ulterior motive whatever. It is one child saying to another child, “Let’s be dragons,” and then they’re dragons for an hour or two. It is escapism of the most admirable kind—the game played for the game’s sake. On another level, it is still a game, but a game played for very high stakes. Seen thus, as art, not spontaneous play, its affinity is not with daydream, but with dream. It is a different approach to reality, an alternative technique for apprehending and coping with existence. It is not antirational but pararational; not realistic, but surrealistic, superrealistic, a heightening of reality. In Freud’s terminology, it employs primary, not secondary process thinking. It employs archetypes, which, Jung warned us, are dangerous things. Dragons are more dangerous, and a good deal commoner, than bears. Fantasy is nearer to poetry, to mysticism, and to insanity than naturalistic fiction is. It is a real wilderness, and those who go there should not feel too safe.

Literary fiction is a genre, and I will fight to the death anyone who denies this very self-evident truth.So, is there a lot of fantasy that is raw shit out there? Absolutely, absolutely, it’s popcorn reading at best. But you can’t deny that a lot of lit fic is also shit. 85% of everything in the world is shit. We judge by the best. And there is some truly excellent fantasy out there. For example, Midsummer Night’s Dream; Hamlet with the ghost; Macbeth, ghosts and witches; I’m also fond of the Odyessey; Most of the Pentateuch in the Old Testament, Gargantua and Pantagruel.Honestly, fantasy existed before lit fic, and if you deny those roots you’re pruning yourself so closely that you can’t help but wither and die.","author":"Patrick Rothfuss","category":"fantasy, fantasy-fiction, fiction, literary-fiction, writing"},{"quote":"He does not despise real woods because he has read of enchanted woods","author":"the reading makes all real woods a little enchanted.","category":"C.S.

It is instead the fantasy of a guy who can give you everything.

No more worrying about what to wear. Christian buys her clothes. No more stress about how to be in the bedroom. Christian makes those decisions. For women who do too much—which includes, dear publishers, pretty much all the women who have enough disposable income to buy your books—this is the ultimate fantasy: not a man who will make you come, but a man who will make agency unnecessary, a man who will choose your adventure for you.","author":"Jennifer Weiner, All Fall Down","category":"fantasy, fifty-shades-of-grey, no-worries"},{"quote":"I don't have expensive tastes – just bloody ones.– Vampire Dragul Mangorian","author":"John Matsui, Late Bite","category":"action-adventure, courtroom-drama, fantasy, horror, paranormal-thriller"},{"quote":"When my turn on the program comes, I am not nervous at all—because all this is happening out of time, out of space.

When he put together his bunch of provisions, he never thought about bringing sunblock. Aragorn never wore sunblock. Taran never wore sunblock. Percy never wore sunblock. But despite all that precedent for going without, he was pretty sure his nose would be lobster-red the next time he looked in the mirror.He was thirsty, too, something that happened a lot in books, but his dry throat bothered him more than it had ever seemed to bother any character.And, unlike in books where random brigands and monsters jumped out just when things got unbearably dull, there was nothing to fight except for the clouds of gnats, several of which Zach was pretty sure he'd accidentally swallowed.","author":"Holly Black, Doll Bones","category":"adventuring, fantasy, humorous, reality"},{"quote":"He wondered fleetingly how many people who sat alone for hours as they scribbled their stories practiced talking about their work during their coffee breaks....","author":"Robert Galbraith, The Silkworm","category":"authors, conceit, fantasy, publicity, publishing, self-regard"},{"quote":"A wounded animal yet bears teeth","author":"Billie-Jo Williams, The Book of Redemption","category":"adventure, angel, debut-novel, destiny-of-dragons, dragon, dragons, ebook, environment, epic, epic-fantasy, facebook, fantasy, fiction, good-vs-evil, indie-author, kindle, magic, military-fantasy, nook, persecution, pirates, romance, self-published, series, smashwords, tyranny, vampires, werewolf, werewolves"},{"quote":"Here is Belladonna, the Lady of the Rocks,\tThe lady of situations.Here is the man with three staves, and here the Wheel,\tAnd here is the one-eyed merchant, and this card,\tWhich is blank, is something he carries on his back,\tWhich I am forbidden to see.

Fantasy acknowledges that, whereas a lot of modern literature is trying to distance itself from 'story,' never mind anything else.

This is internal peace, a rest of mind and soul that escapes most of us. 3) Peace with God. ‘Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ’ (Romans 5:1 NIV 2011 Edition). This is eternal peace, and it comes from knowing you’ve a right relationship with God.

You say, ‘But I see no way for it to come to pass.’ The Bible says, ‘The vision is yet for an appointed time … wait for it; because it will surely come’ (Habakuk 2 v. 3 NKJV). You may not know how to get from where you are right now to where the vision will ultimately take you - but God does. So ask Him to reveal the next step to you. Whether you’re in prison like Joseph, in a soup kitchen in the inner city, or at home taking care of small children, God will fulfil the vision He placed in your heart. The more you see yourself leading in the boardroom, launching your own business, serving in ministry, writing your first book, or helping others through your gifts, the sooner it’ll become a reality.","author":"Patience Johnson, Why Does an Orderly God Allow Disorder","category":"best-inspirational-quotes, best-motivational-quotes, inspirational-life-quotes, inspirational-quotes-about-life, inspirational-quotes-for-work, inspirational-quotes-of-the-day, life-quotes, life-quotes-inspirational-quotes, motivational-quotes, quotes-about-life, quotes-of-the-day-motivational, quotes-on-life"},{"quote":"Many of the people God used in Scripture looked like losers before they looked like winners. After the disciples fished all night and caught nothing, Jesus told them, ‘…Do not be afraid. From now on you will catch men’ (Luke 5:10 NKJV). They did, and they ended up: a) building a church that’s still thriving two thousand years later; b) writing history’s greatest books; c) having our sons named after them. Does that mean you can just dream a dream and God will fulfil it? No. Paul says, ‘…You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honour God…’ (1 Corinthians 6:19-20 NIV).","author":"Patience Johnson, Why Does an Orderly God Allow Disorder","category":"best-inspirational-quotes, best-motivational-quotes, inspirational-life-quotes, inspirational-quotes-about-life, inspirational-quotes-for-work, inspirational-quotes-of-the-day, life-quotes, life-quotes-inspirational-quotes, motivational-quotes, quotes-about-life, quotes-of-the-day-motivational, quotes-on-life"},{"quote":"This verse just came to my mind yesterday while sitting in the train...‘Pursue … overtake … and … recover all.’1 Samuel 30:8When King David and his men returned home from battle, they discovered that the Amalekites had burned their homes to the ground and taken their families prisoner. They were devastated. They wept until they’d no tears left. Then God spoke to them and said, ‘Pursue … overtake … and … recover all.’ And with His help they did! So no matter how bad your situation looks right now, don’t give up. Cry if you have to, then dry your tears and go out in God’s strength and take back what the Enemy has stolen from you. If necessary, take it an inch at a time, drawing on His strength and not your own. Paul writes: ‘Let us not lose heart and grow weary and faint in acting nobly and doing right, for in due time and at the appointed season we shall reap, if we do not loosen and relax our courage and faint’ (Galatians 6:9 AMP Classic Edition). God won’t quit on you, so don’t quit on Him! He has promised in His Word: ‘When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and when you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned; the flames will not set you ablaze. For I am the LORD your God’ (Isaiah 43:2-3 NIV 2011 Edition). Don’t give up - go through! It’s easy to quit, but it takes faith to go through. When your faith honours God, He honours your faith! And with Him on your side you’ll come out stronger than you were when you went in. So the word for you today is: ‘Pursue … overtake … and … recover all.","author":"Patience Johnson, Why Does an Orderly God Allow Disorder","category":"best-inspirational-quotes, best-motivational-quotes, inspirational-life-quotes, inspirational-quotes-about-life, inspirational-quotes-for-work, inspirational-quotes-of-the-day, life-quotes, life-quotes-inspirational-quotes, motivational-quotes, quotes-about-life, quotes-of-the-day-motivational, quotes-on-life"},{"quote":"My dear friend, a good attitude will determine your altitude.
