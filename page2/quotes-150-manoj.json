A tea-dress like girls used to wear, with big red poppies all over the fabric. A pair of flat, white pumps, comfortable but really pretty. A bicycle with a basket on the front. In the basket is a loaf of fresh bread, cheese, fruit oh...and a bottle of sparkly wine, you know, like posh people drink. “I’m cycling down a lane. There are no lorries or cars or bicycles. No people – just me. The sun is shining through the trees, making patterns on the ground. At the end of the lane is a gate, sort of hidden between the bushes and trees. I stop at the gate, get off the bike and wheel it into the garden.“In the garden there are flowers of all kinds, especially roses. They’re my favourite. I walk down the little path to a cottage. It’s not big, just big enough. The front door needs painting and has a little stained glass window at the top. I take the food out of the basket and go through the door. “Inside, everything is clean, pretty and bright. There are vases of flowers on every surface and it smells sweet, like lemon cake. At the end of the room are French windows. They need painting too, but it doesn’t matter. I go through the French windows into a beautiful garden. Even more flowers there...and a veranda. On the veranda is an old rocking chair with patchwork cushions and next to it a little table that has an oriental tablecloth with gold tassels. I put the food on the table and pour the wine into a glass. I’d sit in the rocking chair and close my eyes and think to myself... this is my place.”From A DISH OF STONES","author":"Valentina Hepburn, A DISH OF STONES","category":"a-dish-of-stones, family-saga, fiction, fiction-novel, valentina-hepburn"},{"quote":"We are one.","author":"Thomas Sweeney, The Harem","category":"contemporary, drama, erotic, erotica, fiction, romance-love, the-harem"},{"quote":"I am a knight riding from tower to tower seeking a princess to rescue but all the dragons are slain, the towers are empty and the princesses taken.","author":"Pieter Niemand","category":"fiction, knight, lonely, medieval, princess"},{"quote":"...there are women who devote themselves entirely to their families, their husbands and children, and give up cultivating their femininity.

When Pilate asks the crowd which prisoner they would like to have released—Jesus, the preacher and traitor to Rome, or bar Abbas, the insurrectionist and murderer—the crowd demands the release of the insurrectionist and the crucifixion of the preacher. \"Why?\" Pilate asks, pained at the thought of having to put an innocent Jewish peasant to death. “What evil has he done?” But the crowd shouts all the louder for Jesus’s death. \"Crucify him! Crucify him!\" (Mark 15:1–20). The scene is absolutely nonsensical. Never mind that outside the gospels there exists not a shred of historical evidence for any such Passover custom on the part of any Roman governor. What is truly beyond belief is the portrayal of Pontius Pilate—a man renowned for his loathing of the Jews, his total disregard for Jewish rituals and customs, and his penchant for absentmindedly signing so many execution orders that a formal complaint was lodged against him in Rome—spending even a moment of his time pondering the fate of yet another Jewish rabble-rouser.","author":"Reza Aslan, Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth","category":"bible, fiction, history, pilate"},{"quote":"Stallions,\" Frank said, \"they're fightin' over a girl. - DANIEL'S ESPERANZA","author":"Veronica Randolph Batterson, Daniel's Esperanza","category":"abuse, equine, fiction, horse, literary-fiction, native-american, navajo, new-mexico, ranch, stallions, wild-horse, wild-mustang"},{"quote":"You look within and upon and around me, savoring every inch.

In fact, there is no such thing as character, something fixed and final. The real thing is something that novelists don’t know how to write about.

It was dark when Lucius reached the rendezvous which had been chosen to be the new hideout. The latter had been used for several months and they were concerned that they were being followed and were close to being discovered. \"I thought you were not coming. I've been waiting for you for almost an hour. I was getting anxious,\" Sofia said, relieved. \"Sorry, love. It is becoming increasingly difficult. I almost didn't make it today. The troops were ambushed in the last invasion. Igor and many warriors returned seriously injured,\" Lucius replied. He looked worried. Why this sudden encounter? They had agreed that the next would be the following week. Lucius gave her a big hug, pulled her close to him, and remained silent for a few moments. His longing and desire consumed him. She meant the world to him. Without Sofia, his life would never make sense. He would never forget those eyes, serene and sincere, with a blue so bright and clear that were able to see the soul of the tormented warrior that was he. With her golden hair, Sofia looked like an angel. \"Is there a problem? You're so quiet and deep in thought,\" she asked, puzzled. He answered, \"I'm thinking about us. How long are we keeping it secret?\" He walked away from her, sighing. \"We can't keep lying and pretending that all is well. You have no idea how much I have to endure when you are away from me, or when I see you with him.\" \"Love, not now. We have already discussed this subject several times. You know that our only alternative would be to ﬂee and pray they will never find us,\" she replied. Sofia knew very well that the laws of the kingdom could not be disregarded. Love, respect, and loyalty were key factors that were part of the hierarchy of Orfheus. Although she had always been in love with Lucius who had never shown any interest in her, Sofia was bound to his brother Alex as a result of a pact. Over the centuries, Lucius began to change and express loving feelings for her. She never ceased to love him and both succumbed to the temptation and passion of it. Inevitably, a love affair developed between the two. Interrupting her thoughts, Lucius grabbed her by the hand and led her into the hut. This hut was located inside a vast and beautiful forest. He pulled her by the waist, gave her a passionate kiss, stroked her hair, and said softly, \"Love, I missed you so much.\" \"I also felt homesick but the real reason I came here today is to tell you something very important. I need you to listen carefully and keep calm,\" she said as she ran her hands through her hair which contrasted with her pale skin. Sofia did not want to scare him. However, she imagined that he would be upset and angry with the news. Unfortunately, the revelation was inevitable and sooner or later, everything would come out. \"I'm pregnant,\" she said unceremoniously. For a brief moment, Lucius said nothing. He just stared at her without any reaction. He seemed to be in a silent battle with his own thoughts. \"But how?\" he babbled, not believing what he had just heard. It was surely a bombshell revelation. That would be the end for them. Sofia said, \"Stay calm, love. I know this changes everything. What we were planning for months is no longer possible.\" She sat on a makeshift stool and continued with tears in her eyes. \"With the baby coming, I cannot simply go through the portal. The baby and I would die during the crossing.\" Lucius replied, \"Could we ask for help from Aunt Wilda? She is very powerful. Probably she would be able to break through the magic of the portals.\" Sofia had already thought of that. She was well aware that it was the only choice left. Aunt Wilda had always been like a mother to her. The sorceress adopted her when she was a girl, soon after her family had died in combat.","author":"Gisele de Assis","category":"fantasy, fiction, romance, young-adult"},{"quote":"It was the love which the hunter has for living things, and which he can only express by aiming his gun at them ...","author":"Italo Calvino","category":"baron-in-the-trees, fiction, italian"},{"quote":"I am not as valuable as the books, I AM the books!

He's just doing it the Lakota way, by laying out the history. That's how we remember our history, by telling our story,\" \"But does every story have to start with Columbus?\" \"Everything starts with Columbus. At least everything to do with white people.\" \"But what's with the French fries?\" \"He likes to get rid of the salt.\" \"No, the piles. First he insists on getting exactly twenty-eight, then he divides them into piles. It doesn't make any sense.\" A small smile crept across Grover's face. \"How many piles?\" he asked. \"Four.\" He spit one more time onto the ground. It made a small puff of explosion in the dust. \"Mmm. Twenty-eight French fries. Four piles of seven.\" He made a great charade of counting on his fingers. \"Let's see. Four seasons. Four directions.

Fictions exist because of this fact. Because we have only one life, and our desires and fantasies demand a thousand lives. Because the abyss between what we are and what we would like to be has to be bridged somehow.

My job is to have been true enough to the world of my story that I was able to present it as a forceful and convincing drama. Every story is a kind of puzzle. Many have obvious solutions, and some have no solution at all. We write to present questions, sometimes complicated questions, not to offer easy or not-so-easy answers. Do not be misled by the limited vocabulary the American marketplace uses to describe the possibilities for story and drama. If we’re really writing we are exploring the unnamed emotional facets of the human heart. Not all emotions, not all states of mind have been named. Nor are all the names we have been given always accurate. The literary story is a story that deals with the complicated human heart with an honest tolerance for the ambiguity in which we live. No good guys, no bad guys, just guys: that is, people bearing up the crucible of their days and certainly not always—if ever—capable of articulating their condition.","author":"Ron Carlson, Ron Carlson Writes a Story","category":"fiction, on-writing"},{"quote":"It was only much later that he was made flesh and blood [in the Gospels] on paper.

This conception, again, I take from Kafka, who, although he was never transformed into an insect, and although he never had a piece of food (an apple from his family's table!) lodged in his flesh and rotting there, devoted his whole life as a writer to describing his personal struggle with his family, with women, with moral law, with his Jewish heritage, with his Unconscious, with his sense of guilt, and with the modern world. Kafka's work, which grows out of the nighttime dreamworld in Kafka's brain, is *more* autobiographical than any realistic retelling of his daytime experiences at the office or with his family or with a prostitute could have been. What is fiction, after all, if not a kind of purposeful dreaming? The writer works to create a dream that is vivid and has meaning, so that the reader can then vividly dream it and experience meaning. And work like Kafka's, which seems to proceed directly from dream, is therefore an exceptionally pure form of autobiography. There's an important paradox here that I would like to stress: the greater the autobiographical content of a fiction writer's work, the *smaller* its superficial resemblance to the writer's actual life. The deeper the writer digs for meaning, the more the random particulars of the writer's life become *impediments* to deliberate dreaming.","author":"Jonathan Franzen, Farther Away","category":"fiction, kafka, novel, writing"},{"quote":"(From the Author Note at the beginning of the book.)

The earlier a story, the more likely it stresses pulp elements: one-dimensional macho protagonists, preposterous methods of murder, hordes of cardboard gangsters, dialogue full of whiny insults, blistering fast action. But even in some of his earliest crime stories one finds aspects of noir, and over time the stream works itself pure.In mature Woolrich the world is an incomprehensible place where beams happen to fall, and are predestined to fall, and are toppled over by malevolent powers; a world ruled by chance, fate and God the malign thug. But the everyday life he portrays is just as terrifying and treacherous. The dominant economic reality is the Depression, which for Woolrich usually means a frightened little guy in a rundown apartment with a hungry wife and children, no money, no job, and desperation eating him like a cancer. The dominant political reality is a police force made up of a few decent cops and a horde of sociopaths licensed to torture and kill, whose outrages are casually accepted by all concerned, not least by the victims.

For it is not the strength of the mothers that is at fault but their weakness, their passive childlike dependency and immaturity that is mistaken for \"femininity.\" Our society forces boys, insofar as it can, to grow up, to endure the pains of growth, to educate themselves to work, to move on. Why aren't girls forced to grow up - to achieve somehow the core of self that will end the unnecessary dilemma, the mistaken choice between femaleness and humanness that is implied in the feminine mystique?","author":"Betty Friedan, The Feminine Mystique","category":"feminism, gender-stereotypes"},{"quote":"My sister burns, and she does not burn for you.","author":"E.K.

Men give more lectures. Men ask more questions after lectures. Men post more e-mail to Internet discussion groups. To say this is due to patriarchy is to beg the question of the behavior's origin. If men control society, why don't they just shut up and enjoy their supposed prerogatives? The answer is obvious when you consider sexual competition: men can't be quiet because that would give other men a chance to show off verbally. Men often bully women into silence, but this is usually to make room for their own verbal display. If men were dominating public language just to maintain patriarchy, that would qualify as a puzzling example of evolutionary altruism—a costly, risky individual act that helps all of one's sexual competitors (other males) as much as oneself. The ocean of male language that confronts modern women in bookstores, television, newspapers, classrooms, parliaments, and businesses does not necessarily come from a male conspiracy to deny women their voice. It may come from an evolutionary history of sexual selection in which the male motivation to talk was vital to their reproduction.","author":"Geoffrey Miller, The Mating Mind: How Sexual Choice Shaped the Evolution of Human Nature","category":"biology, feminism, psychology"},{"quote":"Rachel,” I snap, “I don’t care if Janelle wants to work at Hooters.
