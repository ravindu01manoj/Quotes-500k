It's that people just like to tell themselves stories about where they came from. They can't help themselves. They don't trust the world around them--it's too good for them, or not good enough--so they tell themselves stories about it. They tell themselves an old magician who lives up in the sky made them out of clay and put them here until whenever he makes up his mind to take them out again. Your parents didn't like their creation myth, that's all--it had pain in it, and chaos, and their own parents were ashamed. So they told themselves a story that was at least partially true: about two good people who deserved happy lives. And probably at some point they started to believe that story. But the thing is, really, that it doesn't matter. For your parents or anyone else. It doesn't actually matter where we came from, or where we're going, or when. The only thing that matters is what we have to do while we're here and how well we do it.","author":"Katie Coyle, Vivian Apple at the End of the World","category":"creation-myth, creationism, existence, existentialism, god, life, living, memory"},{"quote":"My prayer for you:Know the Lord in greater depth.Abide in the presence of God.Live under the shelter of most High,God.Remain under the shadow of God’s grace in Jesus Name.Amen.","author":"Lailah Gifty Akita, Think Great: Be Great!","category":"answers-to-prayer, challenges-quotes, chrisitan, chrisitanity, christianity, christianity-faith, courageous, desire-to-learn, desire-to-live, desires, desires-and-dreams, desires-quotes, faith, faith-in-god, faith-strength, fulfilling-purpose, fulfilling-your-destiny, fulfilling-your-potential, healing-the-emotional-self, inner-strength, living, potential-for-greatness, potential-quotes, prayer-warrior, prayer-worship, prayers-answered, prayers-of-the-heart, praying, praying-and-fasting, praying-dad, praying-for-enemies, praying-for-love, praying-mind, praying-mum, praying-right, spiritual-quotes, spiritual-wisdom, spirituality, survivors, wishes, wishes-for-new-year, wishes-fulfilled, wishes-quotes"},{"quote":"Happiness is an art and the one who knows this art lives happily even if they don't have anything.","author":"Raaz Ojha","category":"art, art-of-living, blessing, happiness, learning, life, living, success"},{"quote":"Living in the past is like choosing to cling to a chronic illness.","author":"Asa Don Brown","category":"acceptance, forgiveness, living, love, past"},{"quote":"It's not in the life, it's in the living.","author":"Raheel Farooq","category":"life, life-and-living, life-experience, life-lessons, lifestyle, living, living-in-the-present, living-life, living-life-to-the-fullest"},{"quote":"I honor the divine on a daily basis, but I want to know that the greatest magick in my life is living authentically with what I have and can do.","author":"Thomm Quackenbush, Pagan Standard Times: Essays on the Craft","category":"authentic, divine, life, living, magick, worship"},{"quote":"Best way to clear the air is to have it all out in the open.","author":"Harper Lee","category":"bravery, hope, life-lessons, living, love, mocking-bird, peace, truth, world-view"},{"quote":"Love is for the living, for people who have a stake in the future.","author":"Simon R.

But I think that they didn’t see that they had power, because they had been told that they didn’t.When you think about the power that people have (especially today), you can see that if something (like the collapse of banks) were to happen, we would all be perfectly okay. We still have inventors, builders, farmers, gardeners, entertainers, doctors, barristas, sports people, writers, etc. They don’t disappear. We could simply just go on, do what we love, and not worry about income from those pursuits. And everyone would be okay. Probably better, in-fact. No worry about paying bills, or affording things we want (or need). Too bad that people (during the depression) never thought to do that.

You must feel every possible emotion to realize you’re really alive, you’re really living. If you build walls and you hide behind them in fear, you’re not embracing moments, you’re not actually living. And if you’re not living, then you’re dead. Maybe not physically, but mentally and emotionally, you are non-existent. Why would you want to waste such precious time, non-existing, especially behind a crumby wall? Fear? Fear of what? Fear of something great? Fear of something amazing? Hurt? Fear of pain? Isn’t pain what makes us appreciate feelings of absolute happiness and love? Who doesn’t want happiness? Let me be the one to tell you that this life is short, it’s damn short. So, let go of your grudges, your past, your stupid walls and feel reality. Avoidance is not life. Pain is life, happiness is life, emotion is life. Live your damn life. Stop being dead. Embrace every good feeling in your heart and soul and act on it without the fear of hurt, because undoubtedly hurt will happen, but hurt will also disappear and lead to the most valuable feelings in this world. Regret is not something you want to live with in this short, short life. So follow that tiny fist sized drum in your chest because it is honest and it is true. Take those fucking chances, take them knowing this world is full of opportunity, opportunity for great things, absolutely amazing fucking things. Take chance because that is living and no one wants to be dead. No one really wants to hide behind these crumby walls. Walls are built for protection, but guess what? You’re not protecting yourself, you are limiting yourself. You’re limiting your existence. You are the source of your suffering. You’re missing out on the best opportunities by hiding behind these shit walls. So you8 want to play it safe? Why? Life is for taking the risks, for closing your eyes and taking that damn leap of faith. This, this is living; this is your one shot. So take the risk, find opportunity, break down walls, fell the hurt, feel the happiness, live in the now, embrace what your heart is telling you and love EVERY damn moment of your existence.

Dad kicked the shit out of me for crying, but I didn't care. I loved Grandpa, and he was gone. Then, like a month after he'd died, I had this panic attack. I couldn't remember what he looked like. I thought it meant I didn't love him, or that I'd forgotten about him. It was the only time Dad was anything like helpful. He told me you have to forget what they look like.

The modern human mind can engage in reflective thought and selectively determine how to organize the elements of perception. We can consciously elect to depart from stereotypical behavior and transcend the heretofore-established biological behavioral preferences. People can elect to hold prejudices or not, can make rational or irrational decisions to engage in war or not, and can take deliberate steps to arrest destruction of the ecosystem or not. Holding ourselves in check by placing a brake upon the human propensity to strike out in instinctual behavior is a distinct human quality. Restraint from instant gratification of strong impulses represents a unique human behavior trait. By intentionally refraining from committing an instinctual action, humankind asserts its sovereignty from its biological constitution. Unbound from the limitations of its biological nature, a person can employ the mind to devise alternative behavioral choices and the results of numerous behavioral choices culminate to provide a person with a sophisticated definition of the self.","author":"Kilroy J.
