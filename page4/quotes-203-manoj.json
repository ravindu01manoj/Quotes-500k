Love, like genuine devotion, will find a way. Where duty becomes replaced with love, a greater and deeper faith will blossom forth. For the deepest meaning of “belief” refers to being loyal to what the heart already loves. As people used to say, “What the heart loves is the cure.” The cure for healing the wounds and conflicts between faiths and systems of belief involves awakening to the unique ways that each heart carries devotion and love. When followed far enough, simple belief can transform into wisdom; raw passions can become a greater compassion that trusts what resides in one’s heart and even in the hearts of others. Until the heart opens and the eyes begin to see there is always the danger of blindness and narrowness and the tendency to hold onto narrow ways of being.","author":"Michael Meade, Why the World Doesn't End: Tales of Renewal in Times of Loss","category":"compassion, devotion, healing, love"},{"quote":"Complex thinkers attempt to extend to others the same self-forgiving bias that they offer themselves.","author":"Ted Cadsby, Closing the Mind Gap: Making Smarter Decisions in a Hypercomplex World","category":"compassion, complexity, critical-thinking, decision-making"},{"quote":"Have greater compassion and empathy for others, and don't judge anyone, because you have no idea what's going on in their life.","author":"Sandra Vischer, Unliving the Dream","category":"compassion, empathy, inspirational, judgment, life"},{"quote":"...

Doty","category":"compassion, science"},{"quote":"The darker side of Nietzsche’s ideas was incorporated into the Nazi belief system. Part of the link was straightforward: some things Nietzsche said were pure Nazi doctrine. His comments that ‘The extinction of many types of people is just as desirable as any form of reproduction’ and that ‘the tendency must be towards the rendering extinct of the wretched, the deformed, the degenerate’ could come from any work on racial hygiene. Nietzsche’s central contribution was not these explicitly Social Darwinist views, but his rejection of the Judeo-Christian morality of compassion for the weak. Self-creation required hardness towards oneself: a strong will imposing coherence on conflicting impulses. It also requires hardness on others. Conflicts between the self-creative projects of different people made inevitable the attempt to dominate others. The whole of life was a struggle in which victory went to the brave and to the strong-willed. Noble human qualities, linked with the will to power, were brought out in combat but atrophied in peace. Compassion was weakness, cowardice and self-deception. The Judeo-Christian emphasis on it was poison. In drawing these consequences from his beliefs about the death of God and from Social Darwinism, Nietzsche provided the part of the Nazi belief system which ‘justified’ the cruel steps they took to implement their other beliefs.","author":"Jonathan Glover, Humanity: A Moral History of the Twentieth Century","category":"compassion, death-of-god, morality, morality-without-religion, nazism, nietzsche, race, racial-hygiene, social-darwinism, will"},{"quote":"There are miracles and glory in every child.

According to Buddhist thought, a Bodhisattva is someone on the path to Buddhahood wo dedicates themselves entirely to helping all other sentient beings towards release from suffering.

I thought that the hardest part of a loving, mutually healing relationship would be showing my vulnerable, raw spots to a person, even though I'd been hurt so many times before. This has not been the hardest part. The actual hardest part has been realizing that no one, no matter how compassionate and kind they are, will say the perfect things always. Myself included. The hardest part has been learning to communicate what I need, to hear what others need, to tell others how to tell me what they need. Intimacy takes a lot of communication. We all have triggers. I don't know your triggers and you don't know mine. No matter how much I love or trust you, you cannot possibly know exactly the words I need to hear, the words I don't want to hear, and the way I like to be touched. And how strange that we expect these things of each other. How strange, and self-sabotaging, that we refuse to get into relationships and friendships with people unless they treat us in just that perfect way. We've been raised to want fairy tales. We've been raised to wait for flawless saviors to rescue us. But the savior isn't flawless and the savior is not coming. The savior is you. The savior is still learning. The savior is never done learning. The savior is a human being. Forget perfect. Forget flawless. And start speaking your truth. Start speaking what you want and how you want it. And start asking and listening, really listening, to what the people around you say. Maybe, then, we will stop abandoning and hurting each other. Maybe, then, there's hope for us.","author":"Vironika Tugaleva","category":"compassion, healing, hope, love, relationships, rescuing, salvation, self-love, self-salvation, self-understanding, understanding"},{"quote":"Nothing you become will disappoint me; I have no preconception that I'd like to see you be or do.

You do not want to appear too political; you are afraid of seeming controversial; you want to keep a reputation for being balanced, objective, moderate; your hope is to be asked back, to consult, to be on a board or prestigious committee, and so to remain within the responsible mainstream; someday you hope to get an honorary degree, a big prize, perhaps even an ambassadorship. For an intellectual these habits of mind are corrupting par excellence. If anything can denature, neutralize, and finally kill a passionate intellectual life it is the internalization of such habits. Personally I have encountered them in one of the toughest of all contemporary issues, Palestine, where fear of speaking out about one of the greatest injustices in modern history has hobbled, blinkered, muzzled many who know the truth and are in a position to serve it. For despite the abuse and vilification that any outspoken supporter of Palestinian rights and self-determination earns for him or herself, the truth deserves to be spoken, represented by an unafraid and compassionate intellectual.","author":"Edward Said","category":"compassion, controvers, intellectual, intellectual-life, intellectualism, mainstream, palestine, prestige"},{"quote":"So if we love someone, we should train in being able to listen.

The offcamera director asks the poignant question, “What do you think your victims must’ve felt like?” and Anwar initially almost fails to see the connection. Eventually, when the bloody obvious correlation hits him, he thinks it unlikely that his victims were as upset as he was, because he was “really” upset. The director, pressing the film’s point home, says, “Yeah but it must’ve been worse for them, because we were just pretending; for them it was real.”Evidently at this point the reality of the cruelty he has inflicted hits Anwar, because when they return to the concrete garden where the executions had taken place years before, he, on camera, begins to violently gag.This makes incredible viewing, as this literally visceral ejection of his self and sickness at his previous actions is a vivid catharsis. He gagged at what he’d done.After watching the film, I thought—as did probably everyone who saw it—how can people carry out violent murders by the thousand without it ever occurring to them that it is causing suffering? Surely someone with piano wire round their neck, being asphyxiated, must give off some recognizable signs? Like going “ouch” or “stop” or having blood come out of their throats while twitching and spluttering into perpetual slumber?What it must be is that in order to carry out that kind of brutal murder, you have to disengage with the empathetic aspect of your nature and cultivate an idea of the victim as different, inferior, and subhuman.

The conventional meaning of compassion denotes the latter, active part of this definition, and, due to the accretions of Christian connotation, response is limited to specifically virtuous activity. “Responsiveness” defines the origin and cause of selfless activity that can encompass all manner of response. On this nondual Dzokchen path virtue is the effect, not the cause; the ultimate compassionate response is whatever action maximizes Knowledge—loving kindness is the automatic function of Awareness.","author":"Keith Dowman, The Flight of the Garuda: The Dzogchen Tradition of Tibetan Buddhism","category":"compassion, dzogchen"},{"quote":"Being happy at work is possible for all of us, anytime & anywhere, with open eyes and a caring heart","author":"Sharon Salzberg, Real Happiness at Work: Meditations for Accomplishment, Achievement, and Peace","category":"compassion, mindfulness, work"},{"quote":"You will achieve what you want to achieve, only if you can cope with the theory of altruism.","author":"Michael Bassey Johnson","category":"achievement, achievers, altruism, benevolence, compassion, feelings, giver, giving, help, helping, helping-the-poor, letting-go, love, magnanimity, michael-bassey-johnson, pity, poverty, rendering, sacrifice, surrender, unattachment"},{"quote":"They learned no compassion from their own anguish.

We locate ourselves with the poor and the powerless and the voiceless. At the edges, we join the easily despised and the readily left out. We stand with the demonized so that the demonizing will stop. We situate ourselves right next to the disposable so that the day will come when we stop throwing people away.","author":"Gregory J.

To them I say, had you lived my life, you would not believe it. I have known the depths to which mortals are capable of descending, and I have seen the heights. I have seen how kindness and compassion may grow in the unlikeliest of places, as the mountain flower forces its way through the stern rock.","author":"Jacqueline Carey, Kushiel's Dart","category":"compassion, goodness, jacqueline-carey, kindness, kushiels-dart"},{"quote":"Positivity can be a negative,\" I tell her, \"if it's used to diminish events that should be cause for concern. Saying 'bad things happen to good people' or \"God doesn't give anyone more than they can handle', for instance, isn't necessarily helpful to the person to whom something bad happened--it is much more beneficial to those who wish to be dismissive- who don't really care to think about the why or how or who. And if we cease to see the real human part in events--if instead, we relegate human experiences to some sort of mystical concept like karma, destiny or everything happens for a reason, and consider more realistic views to be negative--then we diminish compassion and empathy, as well as the possibility of positive change.","author":"Jane Devin, Elephant Girl: A Human Story","category":"change, compassion, empathy, negative, positive, realistic"},{"quote":"Don't be afraid to make corrections,\" Picchu said. \"Don't be afraid to lend a hand.\" She fell silent, seeming to think for a moment. \"And don't look down.","author":"Diane Duane, So You Want to Be a Wizard","category":"compassion, courage"},{"quote":"Unfortunately we treat others as we treat ourselves.
