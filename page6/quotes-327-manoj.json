Even if my fingers were to clench and wither, even if I were to grow deaf or blind, even if I were unable to move a muscle in my body save for the blink of one eye, I would still write. Writing saved my life. Writing has been my window -- flung wide open to this magnificent, chaotic existence -- my way of interpreting everything within my grasp. Writing has extended that grasp by pushing me beyond comfort, beyond safety, past my self-perceived limits. It has softened my heart and hardened my intellect. It has been a privilege. It has whipped my ass. It has burned into me a valuable clarity. It has made me think about suffering, randomness, good will, luck, memory responsibility, and kindness, on a daily basis -- whether I feel like it or not. It has insisted that I grow up. That I evolve. It has pushed me to get better, to be better. It is my disease and my cure. It has allowed me not only to withstand the losses in my life but to alter those losses -- to chip away at my own bewilderment until I find the pattern in it. Once in a great while, I look up at the sky and think that, if my father were alive, maybe he would be proud of me.

I would go in with great pleasure and I'd never look at what was playing -- what was playing was unimportant. The fact was that I was entering a new world, an environment where not only was it much more attractive than my life was ordinarily, but also I could manipulate it to an extent by coming and going, and by looking at scenes or not, which I could not in my own life.

But then you open the doors, and it’s like you’ve given birth to this new thing that didn’t exist before. Then when it starts to flourish, well, that’s just icing on the cake.

Loving someone who doesn’t love you back. Wanting to kiss them when they don’t. Be someone else while they make you be who you are without effort? Being so at ease that it seems like you’ve known each other for years, even though you never spoke to them, or didn’t speak to them for years?Love is a rare thing. The other person can’t be forced to love you. Can’t make themselves love you, even though they want to, or not.If you ask me, love is something magical. Something totally unknown to human beings. Tell me, is there anyone out there that completely understands love? No, because human beings can’t fully understand something that can’t be understood. Love is a feeling, it’s not a thing, it’s not something that can be explained. Every soul on this earth experiences love in a million different ways. No love is the same, it never will be. No day loving the same person is the same. No day loving someone else is the same.When you love someone, fight. But make sure you lose the fight when it leads to heartache. Because losing that fight will be more rewarding then to keep on fighting for something that can never win. Never lose a fight before it has even started.","author":"Kim Pape","category":"love, love-quotes-and-sayings"},{"quote":"My heart is your home.","author":"Sir Kristian Goldmund Aumann","category":"heart-quote, love-quotes-and-sayings"},{"quote":"Listen, I do care about you.If that time ever comes, when I say \"I don't care\", trust me, in that moment, I will be lying.","author":"Hafsa Shah","category":"caring, caring-for-others, caring-quotes, love, love-quotes-and-sayings"},{"quote":"I was so desperate to be loved that when he made me feel special, I made him my world","author":"dandelionlady96","category":"love, love-quotes-and-sayings"},{"quote":"Love is an eternal shining star.","author":"Sir Kristian Goldmund Aumann","category":"love-quotes-and-sayings, shining-star"},{"quote":"Itsumademo ai shiteru, Yuki.
