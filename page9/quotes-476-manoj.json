With faith, in full conscience, fasting calls women and men to an extra degree of self-awareness.","author":"Tariq Ramadan","category":"Women, Adversity, Men"},{"quote":"Christ commands those who believe to be baptized. Pedobaptists adopt a system which tends to preclude the baptism of believers. They baptize the involuntary infant and deprive him of the privilege of ever professing his faith in the appointed way.

Oklahomans value innovation and the creative arts.","author":"Brad Henry","category":"Children, Innovation, Value"},{"quote":"Theatre's great. It's such an act of faith. It's a wonderful art form where you suspend disbelief for a couple of hours. It's a lovely art form because the actors and the audience are alive and in the room at the same time together. That's why I love the theatre.","author":"Israel Horovitz","category":"Love, Time, Art"},{"quote":"A faith is something you die for, a doctrine is something you kill for. There is all the difference in the world.","author":"Tony Benn","category":"World, Die, You"},{"quote":"I came from a tradition where souls were a theological reality, not a faith reality. Souls were for saving, not for communing. Souls were for converting and, once they were converted, they were to be left alone.
